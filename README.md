This project focuses on predicting individuals' income levels using demographic and socio-economic features from census data. The objective is to build accurate machine learning models to classify whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year. The workflow includes data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Various machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, and ensemble methods were employed. The project also involves handling imbalanced data, hyperparameter tuning, and detailed evaluation using metrics like Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Precision-Recall Curve.
